# Motivation

Your a backend developer, you don't like frontend, and more than that you hate having to make things look nice.
Unfortunately its a hackathon and your the only one who has touched react.js so you not only have to manage making everything on the backend
hyper optimized but now you have to do the job of an art student and make a ui look great.
You read a couple of articles on some designs, chose to use _X_ design library, but you're looking at your options for colors,
and just wish that someone would give you a color pallete that you could use. Not even that, you wish some designer just had something you could take,
and convert directly into your tailwind config, sass, or css files which makes thing easy for us non creative types.

I created a super simple piece of definately buggy code for my own use where I can just put all of the colors I want to use into a .tamu file (gig 'em)
and then convert it to a tailwind.js config. Currently it only supports colors because thats what I care about. But i'm sure at some point in the future, I will
add more.
